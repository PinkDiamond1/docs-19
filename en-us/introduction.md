# CoinEx Smart Chain (CSC)

Based on [`CPoS`](/en-us/consensus.md) consensus protocol, CoinEx Smart Chain (CSC) is a smart contract chain that supports up to 101 validators. Aside from shorter time for block generation and lower fees for transactions, `CSC` is also fully compatible with Ethereum virtual machine(EVM) and protocols while supporting high-performance transactions. Meanwhile, `CSC` adheres to the principle of decentralization and permission-free so that anyone can stake coins and become a validator.

## CSC Features

* Decentralization: Permission-free, anyone can become a validator by staking `CET`.
* EVM compatibility: Fully compatible with Ethereum virtual machine(EVM), which means that almost all DApps, ecosystem components and tools on Ethereum can be migrated to `CSC` directly or with very small changes.
* High performance: 600+ TPS, 3s block time


## CET

`CET` on `CSC` runs the same way as `ETH` runs on Ethereum, and its main functions are:

1. As block reward for validators 
2. To pay for the gas for transfers and contract calls on `CSC `
3. To pay for the transaction fees for deploying smart contracts on `CSC`
4. To be delegated to the selected validators

## Prospect

Itâ€™s hard to forecast the future of CoinEx Smart Chain for the moment because it is constantly evolving. `CSC` is just a small part of the development prospect. In fact, CoinEx is committed to product development and service improvement, and contributes its share to the infrastructure of the blockchain world. 

While ensuring the compatibility between Ethereum and its future upgraded versions, `CSC` will constantly improve the throughput of the blockchain, make the blockchain client easier to use, enhance the security of the custody services, and provide more versatile token cross-chain services. Meanwhile, enriching decentralized applications will be one of the developing directions of CoinEx in the future.
